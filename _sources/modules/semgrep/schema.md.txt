## Semgrep Schema

.. _semgrep_schema:

### SemgrepDeployment

Represents a Semgrep [Deployment](https://semgrep.dev/api/v1/docs/#tag/Deployment), a unit encapsulating a security organization inside Semgrep Cloud. Works as the parent of all other Semgrep resources.

| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first discovered this node  |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| **id** | Unique integer id representing the deployment |
| **slug** | Lowercase string id representing the deployment to query the API |
| **name** | Name of security organization connected to the deployment |

#### Relationships

    ```

### SemgrepSCAFinding

Represents a [Semgrep Supply Chain](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-supply-chain/overview/) finding. This is, a vulnerability in a dependency of a project discovered by Semgrep performing software composition analysis (SCA) and code reachability analysis. Before ingesting this node, make sure you have run Semgrep CI and that it's connected to Semgrep Cloud Platform [Running Semgrep CI with Semgrep Cloud Platform](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-ci/running-semgrep-ci-with-semgrep-cloud-platform/). The API called to retrieve this information is documented at https://semgrep.dev/api/v1/docs/#tag/SupplyChainService.

| description | Description of the vulnerability. |
| package_manager | The ecosystem of the dependency where the finding was discovered (e.g. pypi, npm, maven) |
| severity | Severity of the finding based on Semgrep analysis (e.g. CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) |
| cve_id | CVE id of the vulnerability from NVD. Check [cve_schema](../cve/schema.md) |
| reachability_check | Whether the vulnerability reachability is confirmed, not confirmed or needs to be manually confirmed |
| reachability_condition | Description of the reachability condition (e.g. reachable if code is used in X way) |
| reachability | Whether the vulnerability is reachable or not |
| reachability_risk | Risk of the vulnerability (e.g. CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) based on severity and likelihod, the latter given by reachability status and reachability check. Risk calculation was based on [NIST 800-30r1](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/legacy/sp/nistspecialpublication800-30r1.pdf) Appendix I - Riks Determination and the [reachability exposure](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-supply-chain/triage-and-remediation/#exposure-filters). See [semgrep_sca_risk_analysis.json](https://github.com/lyft/cartography/blob/master/cartography/data/jobs/scoped_analysis/semgrep_sca_risk_analysis.json) for further details |
| transitivity | Whether the vulnerability is transitive or not (e.g. dependency, transitive) |
| dependency | Dependency where the finding was discovered. Includes dependency name and version |
| dependency_fix | Dependency version that fixes the vulnerability |
| ref_urls | List of reference urls for the finding |
| dependency_file | Path of the file where the finding was discovered (e.g. lock.json, requirements.txt) |
| dependency_file_url | URL of the file where the finding was discovered |
| scan_time | Date and time when the finding was discovered in UTC |
| fix_status | Whether the finding is fixed or not based on triage (e.g. open, fixed, ignored) |
| triage_status | Whether the finding is triaged or not (e.g. untriaged, ignored, reopened) |
| confidence | Confidence of the finding based on Semgrep analysis (e.g. high, medium, low) |
